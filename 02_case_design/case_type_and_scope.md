# Case Type and Scope

## Type of Case Study

This repository documents a **process-oriented exploratory case study** focused on client onboarding in early-stage, AI-based software products.

Rather than evaluating financial performance or technical model accuracy, this case study examines **operational and communication systems** that shape onboarding outcomes. The emphasis is on understanding how onboarding failures emerge, propagate, and can be mitigated through structured enablement practices.

This case is exploratory by design. Its purpose is to surface patterns, not to validate a single predefined hypothesis.

## Why This Case Study Matters

In many early-stage technology companies, onboarding is treated as an informal extension of sales or delivery. This approach may work at small scale but often fails as client volume increases or client technical maturity varies.

This case study focuses on onboarding because:

- Onboarding is a critical transition point from promise to value
- Failures at this stage compound downstream costs
- Improvements in onboarding often yield disproportionate impact relative to effort

By framing onboarding as a system rather than an event, this study aims to make implicit processes explicit and improvable.

## Scope of the Case

### Included in Scope
- Client onboarding workflows
- Communication and knowledge transfer mechanisms
- Enablement artifacts (documentation, recordings, guides)
- Expectation setting and negotiation practices
- Feedback and iteration loops during early client usage

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- Revenue, pricing, or profit analysis
- AI model performance or accuracy benchmarking
- Infrastructure or deployment architecture
- Sales funnel optimization

These exclusions are intentional to maintain analytical focus.

## Use of Synthetic Data

Due to data privacy and confidentiality constraints, this case study uses **synthetic data** to model onboarding behavior.

The synthetic data is designed to:
- Reflect realistic onboarding scenarios
- Encode observable signals of onboarding friction
- Enable structured analysis without exposing proprietary information

The goal is not to simulate exact historical events, but to create a plausible dataset that supports reasoning about onboarding processes and tradeoffs.

---

## Success Criteria

This case study is considered successful if it can:
- Clearly articulate recurring onboarding failure modes
- Translate qualitative observations into analyzable structures
- Propose actionable enablement strategies grounded in observed patterns
- Demonstrate analytical depth and decision-oriented thinking

The value of this work lies in clarity, reasoning, and system design rather than numerical optimization.

## Intended Use

This repository is intended to be read as:
- An internal strategy case
- A learning artifact for process design
- A portfolio demonstration of analytical and product thinking

It is not positioned as a production-ready solution.
