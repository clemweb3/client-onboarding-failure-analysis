# client-onboarding-failure-points

A Decision-Driven Product Ops Case Study

### Why this case study exists

Client onboarding is one of the most fragile phases in a SaaS lifecycle. When onboarding fails, the impact is rarely isolated: customer confidence drops, support costs increase, and long-term retention suffers.

This case study explores onboarding not as a UX problem or a data problem alone, but as a cross-functional systems problem involving Sales, Product, Operations, and Support.

The work here is informed by patterns observed in prior business analyst roles in fast-moving software environments. To respect confidentiality, all data is synthetic and all company-specific details are abstracted.t is synthetic and generated to reflect plausible onboarding behaviors. Any references to prior experience are anonymized and used only to inform assumptions.
