# Client Onboarding Failure Analysis

## About This Repository

This repository documents an exploratory case study on client onboarding failure points observed in early-stage, AI-based software products.

The work is grounded in real-world experience from a business analysis role within a startup environment, where onboarding processes were informal, founder-led, and highly dependent on verbal communication. To respect confidentiality and data privacy, all examples, workflows, and datasets used in this repository are either anonymized or synthetically generated.

The goal of this repository is not to build a production system, but to systematically analyze how onboarding failures emerge, how they impact client activation, and how structured enablement practices can mitigate these risks.

## Case Study Context

In early-stage product environments, onboarding is often treated as a one-time event rather than a continuous enablement process. This can lead to:

- Repeated client inquiries despite prior discussions
- Misalignment between client expectations and product capabilities
- Over-reliance on founders or senior staff for clarification
- Limited accessibility to onboarding knowledge for non-technical users

This case study examines these issues through the lens of client enablement, knowledge transfer, and communication design, with a focus on AI-powered products serving non-technical clients.

## Objectives

This repository aims to:

- Identify common client onboarding failure points
- Analyze how communication structure affects client activation
- Explore how documentation, recordings, and negotiated solution framing influence onboarding outcomes
- Demonstrate how synthetic data can be used to model operational processes in the absence of real client data

---

## Scope and Limitations

- This study focuses on onboarding and enablement, not model performance or AI accuracy
- Business metrics such as revenue and profit are intentionally excluded
- All data used is synthetic and designed to reflect realistic onboarding behavior patterns
- Findings are exploratory and context-dependent, not universally prescriptive

---

## Intended Audience

- Hiring managers and interviewers evaluating analytical and product thinking
- Business analysts and early-stage product managers
- Practitioners interested in onboarding system design under constraints

---

## Repository Roadmap

This repository will be developed incrementally and will include:

1. Problem framing and failure point taxonomy  
2. Synthetic dataset design and validation logic  
3. Exploratory analysis of onboarding scenarios  
4. Enablement-focused solution proposals  
5. Reflection on tradeoffs and implementation constraints
