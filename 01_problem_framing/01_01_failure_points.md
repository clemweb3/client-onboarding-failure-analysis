# Client Onboarding Failure Points

## Purpose of This Document

This document outlines recurring client onboarding failure points observed in early-stage, AI-based software products. The analysis is grounded in firsthand experience from a business analyst role in a startup environment, where onboarding processes were informal, fast-moving, and largely undocumented.

To maintain confidentiality, all descriptions focus on patterns and system behaviors rather than specific organizations or clients.

The goal is to frame onboarding issues as systemic problems rather than individual mistakes.

## Failure Point 1: Ownership Ambiguity During Onboarding

### Description
There is no clearly defined owner responsible for end-to-end onboarding success. Responsibilities are informally distributed across founders, developers, and support staff.

### Observed Patterns
- Founders attend most client calls to bridge gaps
- Developers gather requirements directly from clients
- No single role accountable for onboarding outcomes

### Why This Fails
When ownership is unclear, onboarding becomes personality-driven rather than process-driven. Clients rely on specific people instead of a consistent system.

### Impact
- Bottlenecks around senior staff
- Knowledge does not scale
- Onboarding quality varies by client

---

## Failure Point 2: Verbal-Only Knowledge Transfer

### Description
Critical onboarding information is communicated verbally during meetings and calls, with little to no persistent documentation.

### Observed Patterns
- Clients repeatedly ask the same questions
- Decisions discussed earlier are revisited
- Misunderstandings surface late in implementation

### Why This Fails
Clients, especially non-technical ones, cannot reliably retain complex system behavior from verbal explanations alone.

### Impact
- Increased support load
- Frustration on both client and internal teams
- Reduced confidence in the product’s clarity

## Failure Point 3: Absence of Client-Facing Enablement Artifacts

### Description
There is no centralized, accessible repository of onboarding materials tailored to different client technical levels.

### Observed Patterns
- No recordings or walkthroughs
- No step-by-step guides for configuration
- Clients rely on chat messages or ad hoc explanations

### Why This Fails
Without durable artifacts, clients have no way to self-serve or revisit information after onboarding sessions.

### Impact
- Slower client activation
- Repeated clarification calls
- Uneven onboarding experiences

## Failure Point 4: Misaligned Expectation and Scope Negotiation

### Description
Clients are not consistently presented with clear solution options, tradeoffs, and limitations during onboarding.

### Observed Patterns
- Clients assume features are flexible or unlimited
- Technical constraints are introduced late
- Scope renegotiation happens mid-delivery

### Why This Fails
When tradeoffs are not framed early, clients optimize for what they want, not what is feasible.

### Impact
- Developer overload
- Scope creep
- Tension between delivery timelines and exp
