    "## Purpose of This Document\n",
    "\n",
    "This document explains how I \"built\" the simulated world. I created 500 client scenarios to test how different onboarding choices (like giving them a guide vs. just jumping on a call) affect the speed of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The \"Why\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world data is often \"noisy\" and \"skewed.\" If we just used simple averages, the results would look too perfect to be true. To fix this, I introduced three \"Real World\" factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Human Factor:** Not every client reacts the same way. Some \"High-Tech\" clients are still high-maintenance. We added \"randomness\" to simulate personality differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Founder Tax:** In startups, founders often step in to help. While they are experts, they are also busy. Our data reflects that Founder involvement often causes delays simply because their calendars are a expectedly a *nightmare.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Snowball Effect:** Small problems (like missing a setup guide) snowball into bigger problems (like 10 extra support tickets), which eventually causes the client to get frustrated and take longer to reach \"success.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Variables & Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time to First Value (TTFV):** This measures the days from the first call to the moment the client actually gets value from the software.\n",
    "* **Stochastic Noise:** We use \"Poisson\" and \"Exponential\" distributions. In plain English: we ensure most people fall in the middle, but there are always \"long-tail\" outliers (insane projects) to keep the analysis realistic."

    "2.  **Linear Assumptions:** The model assumes that Documentation *always* helps reduce questions. In reality, poorly written documentation can actually increase confusion. We are modeling \"Standard Quality\" enablement here.\n",
    "3.  **Data Distributions:** We used **Exponential distributions** for duration and **Poisson distributions** for counts. This ensures we have \"outlier\" cases (projects that took 50+ days), which is critical for testing how a business handles \"nightmare\" scenarios.\n",
    "4.  **The \"Human\" Element:** By adding a random bias to the Satisfaction score, we ensure that the data isn't \"perfectly correlated.\" This forces the analysis to look for trends rather than simple mathematical certainties."
